GHC bugs & performance issues that I've found

- Using primarray foldl' after unsafeFreezing a mutable boxed primarray (for the
  sake of debug printing) causes mysterious segfaults! I instead changed to safe
  freezing, which works; but officially unsafeFreeze should never segafult! This
  I tested in ghc 9.0.1 and 9.2.1.
